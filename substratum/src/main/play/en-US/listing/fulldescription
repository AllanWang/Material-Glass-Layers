<b>Let your wallpaper shine through with material darkness!</b>

Pitched Apps presents Material Glass, the first ever material theme! This started as a project for the CM engine, but has now been ported to Substratum.

There are no special permissions, no secretive logging, and no freemium trials. Enjoy a transparent theme built for the community.

Material Glass is also proudly open sourced
